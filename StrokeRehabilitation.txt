1 Introduction
Stroke stands as a significant global burden, impacting millions of lives annually and 
presenting a substantial challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Statistics from the World 
Health Organization (WHO) reveal that stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability 
globally. Annually, approximately 13.7 million new cases of stroke are reported, making it a 
prevalent health issue across continents and demographics (1). The latest findings from the 
2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report revealed that stroke continues to hold its position 
as the second leading cause of mortality and the third leading cause of mortality and disability 
combined, measured in terms of disability-adjusted life-years lost (DALYs) worldwide (2). The 
projected economic impact of stroke globally exceeds US$891 billion, accounting for 
approximately 1.12% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (3). Between 1990 and 
2019, there was a significant surge in the burden of stroke, indicated by a 70.0% rise in new 
stroke cases, a 43.0% increase in stroke-related deaths, a 102.0% uptick in existing stroke cases, 
and a 143.0% elevation in DALYs. The majority of the worldwide burden of stroke, accounting 
for 86.0% of deaths and 89.0% of DALYs, was observed in countries categorized as lower-
income and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC).
Considerable variations were evident in age-standardized stroke incidence (six-fold), 
mortality (15-fold), prevalence (four-fold), and DALYs (20-fold) rates across different 
geographical regions. The regions with the highest rates were predominantly observed in 
LMIC, notably in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa (4). Beyond its high incidence,

stroke accounts for a substantial number of deaths globally. Those who 
survive often experience varying degrees of disability, which 
significantly affects their quality of life (5). Disabilities resulting from 
stroke encompass motor impairments, cognitive deficits, speech and 
language difficulties, and psychological challenges (6). The aftermath 
of stroke extends beyond the individual affected, impacting families, 
caregivers, and society at large. The disabilities and long-term care 
needs of stroke survivors impose emotional, financial, and practical 
burdens on families (7, 8). Furthermore, the societal cost is immense, 
encompassing healthcare expenses, loss of productivity, and the need 
for long-term rehabilitation and support services (9). Disparities in 
stroke incidence, management, and outcomes exist globally, often 
correlated with socio-economic factors (10). Low-and middle-income 
countries face greater challenges due to limited access to healthcare 
services, diagnostics, and rehabilitation facilities. These disparities 
contribute to higher mortality rates and poorer recovery outcomes in 
certain regions (11).
Efforts to reduce the global burden of stroke emphasize prevention 
through awareness campaigns targeting risk factors like hypertension, 
smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity (3). Additionally, 
interventions focusing on timely access to acute care, advanced 
treatments such as thrombolytic therapy, and comprehensive 
rehabilitation are crucial in mitigating the impact of stroke (12). 
Addressing the global burden of stroke necessitates collaborative 
efforts between governments, healthcare organizations, advocacy 
groups, and communities. Initiatives aimed at improving access to 
healthcare, enhancing stroke awareness, promoting healthier lifestyles, 
and advancing rehabilitation services are fundamental in reducing the 
burden of stroke on a global scale (13). The pervasive impact of stroke 
underscores the urgent need for concerted global action. Strategies 
encompassing prevention, timely intervention, access to quality 
healthcare, and comprehensive rehabilitation are essential to alleviate 
the burden of stroke and improve outcomes for individuals affected 
by this debilitating condition (14). This paper aims to provide a 
comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of stroke 
rehabilitation, emphasizing the critical phases from diagnosis to 
therapy. By synthesizing current knowledge and highlighting 
emerging trends, this review intends to serve as a resource for 
clinicians, researchers, and policymakers involved in stroke care and 
rehabilitation. This manuscript endeavors to contribute to the evolving 
discourse on stroke rehabilitation by synthesizing and analyzing 
diverse literature from across the spectrum of stroke care. While not 
a systematic review in the traditional sense, this manuscript adopts a 
rigorous approach to literature selection, guided by clear inclusion 
criteria. These criteria prioritize relevance, quality, credibility, diversity 
of perspectives, and a keen focus on emerging technologies and 
innovations in stroke rehabilitation. Central to our approach is the 
recognition of the multifaceted nature of stroke rehabilitation. Each 
section of this manuscript delves into specific aspects of stroke care, 
from the early diagnosis and assessment to the implementation of 
rehabilitation programs across different stages of stroke recovery. By 
integrating evidence from various publication types, including 
original research articles, clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, and review articles, we aim to provide a comprehensive 
overview of the current state of stroke rehabilitation. Moreover, our 
commitment to inclusivity extends beyond the traditional boundaries 
of stroke research. Efforts have been made to incorporate literature 
from diverse geographical regions, healthcare settings, and patient 
populations, acknowledging the unique challenges and perspectives 
that shape stroke rehabilitation practices globally.
Special attention is also given to the exploration of emerging 
technologies and innovations in stroke rehabilitation. From robotics 
to virtual reality and neurostimulation techniques, the evolving 
landscape of rehabilitation technology offers promising avenues for 
enhancing outcomes and improving the quality of life for stroke 
survivors. By embarking on this comprehensive review journey, 
we seek to not only consolidate existing knowledge but also identify 
gaps, challenges, and opportunities for future research and practice in 
stroke rehabilitation. Through our collective efforts, we  aspire to 
contribute to the advancement of evidence-based, patient-centered 
care that optimizes outcomes and fosters resilience in the face 
of stroke.
The multifaceted field of stroke rehabilitation is explored in this 
review paper, providing a comprehensive overview of current 
practices, challenges, and future directions. The paper begins with a 
background on stroke rehabilitation, discussing its significance, 
historical context, and the evolution of practices. This section sets the 
stage for understanding the critical role of rehabilitation in stroke 
recovery. Next, current rehabilitation practices are examined, detailing 
interventions such as early rehabilitation strategies, physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and cognitive 
rehabilitation. Each subsection highlights evidence-based practices 
and their impact on recovery. The challenges and opportunities in 
stroke rehabilitation are then addressed. Issues such as the lack of 
standardized timing for rehabilitation initiation, disparities in access 
to services, stroke-related infections, the need for individualized 
rehabilitation plans, and the importance of interdisciplinary 
collaboration are analyzed. Potential improvements and innovations 
are discussed. Finally, the future directions are explored. Emerging 
trends and advancements, including personalized rehabilitation 
approaches, the integration of neuroplasticity concepts, and the 
development of assistive technologies, are highlighted. These 
innovations are shown to have the potential to transform rehabilitation 
practices and improve outcomes for stroke survivors. This structured 
approach provides a clear roadmap for readers, ensuring a thorough 
coverage of each aspect of stroke rehabilitation. It offers valuable 
insights for clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders in the field.
2 Diagnosis of stroke: clinical 
assessment and imaging techniques
The clinical assessment of stroke involves a comprehensive 
evaluation that begins with taking the patient’s medical history 
(Figure 1). This includes probing into risk factors such as hypertension, 
diabetes, smoking, previous strokes, or heart disease (15). A thorough 
physical examination follows, focusing on neurological assessments. 
This examination evaluates motor function, sensation, coordination, 
reflexes, and cranial nerve function (16). Utilizing scales like the NIH 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) helps in quantifying the severity of stroke 
symptoms, aiding in treatment decisions (17). Additionally, 
determining the time of symptom onset is critical, as certain 
treatments like thrombolytic therapy have a limited window of 
effectiveness after symptom onset (18). Imaging serves as a pivotal 
component in selecting patients for intravenous and intra-arterial 
arterial ischemic stroke treatments. Techniques like computed

tomography (CT) with CT angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) 
with MR angiography are employed to eliminate stroke mimics and 
hemorrhages, ascertain the stroke’s cause and mechanism, delineate 
the extent of brain infarction, and pinpoint arterial blockages (19). 
Imaging has the potential to discern patients who would derive greater 
benefit from revascularization therapies, irrespective of the traditional 
therapeutic time frame. This capability allows for personalized 
treatment decisions, enhancing individual patient outcomes 
significantly (20). Multiparametric CT/MR imaging can determine the 
scope of potentially salvageable brain tissue (penumbra) and 
irreversible brain damage (core) by leveraging CT perfusion and/or 
diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging (21, 22). 
Additionally, the imaging of diffusion-weighted techniques aids in 
evaluating the status of arterial collateral circulation and discerning 
the type and spread of the clot (23).
The primary goals of arterial ischemic stroke imaging involve 
excluding hemorrhage and stroke mimics and identifying optimal 
candidates for IV or IA treatments, considering both the extent of 
confirmed brain damage (core) and the location of arterial blockages 
(24, 25). Arterial ischemic strokes are urgent medical situations where 
treatment decisions (ranging from conservative approaches to IV 
thrombolysis and/or mechanical revascularization) hinge on two 
crucial imaging factors: the timeframe since onset and two primary 
features observed in imaging—parenchymal lesions and arterial 
blockage locations (26, 27). Imaging of the parenchyma is vital for 
confirming the diagnosis and gauging the extent of ischemic damage, 
while vascular imaging, conducted through CT/CTA or MRI/MRA, 
is essential for pinpointing the location of arterial blockages in arterial 
ischemic stroke evaluations (28, 29). Supplementary details about 
collateral flow, penumbra, and core extension can significantly 
enhance the precision of individual treatment decisions. The selection 
of the initial imaging modality for arterial ischemic stroke assessment 
is largely influenced by the immediate 24/7 equipment accessibility 
and its capability to furnish vital information necessary for various 
treatment approaches (29, 30). Due to its broader availability, CT 
stands as the most widely utilized imaging technique globally for acute 
stroke. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) utilizes ultrasound to assess 
blood flow in the brain’s blood vessels, aiding in the evaluation of 
stroke and identifying conditions like vasospasm, providing valuable 
insights into the vascular aspects of stroke pathology (31). 
Telemedicine and mobile imaging have revolutionized stroke care, 
particularly in areas with limited access to specialized stroke expertise.

Remote evaluation of stroke patients using telemedicine enables 
timely assessment and consultation with stroke specialists, facilitating 
rapid decision-making and treatment initiation (32). Artificial 
intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into imaging 
analysis, showing promising results in quickly and accurately 
detecting stroke. AI-assisted analysis helps clinicians by providing 
rapid insights into imaging data, aiding in prompt diagnosis and 
subsequent treatment planning (33). Emerging research highlights 
the capacity of AI to enhance stroke prognosis. Lukić et al. (34) 
pioneered an artificial neural network (ANN)-driven framework for 
predicting outcomes in cases of stroke. Meanwhile, Wang et al. (35) 
utilized machine learning to construct a random forest model for 
stroke prognosis. Additionally, Xu et  al. (36) amalgamated CT 
radiomics with machine learning methods to devise stroke prognostic 
models integrating 18 CT imaging attributes. These novel approaches 
have optimized the selection of risk factors and expanded the 
inclusion of imaging features, thus bolstering predictive precision. 
Moreover, deep learning has surfaced as a hopeful avenue for 
prognostic forecasting leveraging imaging data. Chen et  al. (37) 
formulated a predictive model centered on convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs), blending clinical data with extensive imaging 
characteristics to address prior constraints of stroke prognostic 
frameworks. Their results indicate heightened predictive efficacy of 
the clinic-imaging fusion CNN model. This model stands poised for 
integration into clinical practice, offering the prospect of enhanced 
management for ICH patients. These technological advancements in 
stroke diagnosis significantly improve the speed and accuracy of 
assessments, allowing for rapid initiation of appropriate treatments, 
thereby minimizing brain damage and enhancing the prospects of 
recovery for stroke patients.
3 Early identification of rehabilitation 
needs
Upon a patient’s arrival following a stroke, a comprehensive 
clinical assessment is crucial. This assessment involves a detailed 
evaluation of the patient’s neurological status, encompassing motor 
function, sensation, coordination, and cognitive abilities. It helps in 
swiftly identifying any deficits or impairments resulting from the 
stroke (38). Additionally, assessing speech, language, and swallowing 
abilities early on is vital. This immediate evaluation assists in 
identifying any communication impairments or dysphagia, indicating 
the need for specialized speech and language therapy (39).
Utilizing tools such as NIHSS aids in objectively quantifying 
the severity of stroke symptoms. This assessment provides critical 
information to healthcare professionals about the extent and 
severity of impairments, guiding decisions on the urgency and 
intensity of rehabilitation interventions (40). Functional 
assessments, like the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), play 
a crucial role in determining the patient’s level of independence in 
performing activities of daily living (ADLs). These assessments aid 
in highlighting specific areas requiring focused rehabilitation 
efforts (41). As mentioned previously, imaging techniques, such as 
CT scans MRI not only confirm the diagnosis of stroke but also 
offer insights into the location and extent of brain damage. 
Integrating these imaging findings with clinical deficits assists in 
understanding the specific deficits correlated with affected brain 
regions. This correlation is pivotal in guiding the development of 
targeted rehabilitation strategies tailored to the individual’s needs 
(21, 42).
Initiating rehabilitation interventions as early as possible post-
stroke, even within the acute phase, is associated with improved 
outcomes. Early interventions may involve passive range-of-motion 
exercises, early mobilization, or cognitive stimulation exercises. 
These early initiatives aim to prevent secondary complications, 
promote neural plasticity, and lay the groundwork for subsequent 
rehabilitation efforts (43, 44). Concurrently, setting rehabilitation 
goals in collaboration with the patient and their caregivers helps 
establish a clear direction for therapy. These goals are individualized, 
realistic, and aimed at improving functional abilities based on the 
identified impairments (45). Involving a multidisciplinary team 
comprising 
various 
specialists—such 
as 
physiotherapists, 
occupational 
therapists, 
speech-language 
pathologists, 
psychologists, and social workers—is instrumental. This 
collaborative approach ensures a comprehensive assessment and 
identification of rehabilitation needs from various perspectives. 
Each specialist brings unique expertise to the table, contributing to 
the development of a holistic rehabilitation plan tailored to the 
patient’s specific impairments and goals (14). Furthermore, engaging 
family members or caregivers right from the beginning allows them 
to grasp the rehabilitation process, receive training on assisting the 
patient, and create a supportive environment upon the patient’s 
discharge (46). Early identification of stroke rehabilitation needs 
through a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach sets the 
stage for a focused, individualized, and timely rehabilitation plan, 
significantly impacting the trajectory of recovery for stroke 
survivors (47).
4 Stages of stroke and corresponding 
rehabilitation programs
Stroke recovery is typically categorized into three stages: acute, 
subacute, and chronic. Each stage has distinct characteristics and 
rehabilitation needs, which are critical for optimizing patient 
outcomes (Table 1).
4.1 Acute stage of stroke
The acute stage of stroke encompasses the first 24 h to 1 week 
following the onset of the stroke. During this initial phase, the primary 
focus is on medical stabilization and preventing further brain damage 
(99). Immediate medical interventions are crucial, including measures 
to restore blood flow, such as the administration of tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA) for ischemic strokes or surgical procedures to address 
hemorrhagic strokes (100). Early rehabilitation efforts aim to prevent 
complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pressure sores, and 
contractures. Gentle mobilization, proper positioning, and passive 
range of motion exercises are implemented to maintain some level of 
physical function. Basic activities of daily living (ADL) training, 
including assistance with eating, dressing, and personal hygiene, are 
introduced to help patients maintain a degree of independence. 
Psychological support is also essential at this stage to help patients and 
their families cope with the emotional impact of the stroke (101).

4.2 Subacute stage of stroke
The subacute stage occurs from 1 week to three to 6 months post-
stroke. This phase is marked by more intensive rehabilitation efforts 
aimed at promoting neurological recovery and improving functional 
abilities (102). During the subacute stage, patients typically engage in 
comprehensive rehabilitation programs that include physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy. Physical 
therapy focuses on improving strength, coordination, balance, and 
mobility through exercises and activities tailored to the patient’s needs 
(103). Occupational therapy helps patients regain the ability to 
perform daily tasks, such as dressing, bathing, and cooking, by using 
techniques like constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and 
dual-task training (104). Proprioceptive training is also incorporated 
to enhance the patient’s sense of body position and movement (105). 
Speech and language therapy continues to address communication 
and swallowing difficulties (106). Psychological counseling and 
support remain vital to address any emotional and cognitive 
challenges that arise during this phase of recovery (107).
4.3 Chronic stage of stroke
The chronic stage of stroke begins 6 months after the initial event 
and extends indefinitely. During this phase, the focus shifts to long-
term rehabilitation and the management of any residual disabilities. 
The goal is to maintain and further improve functional abilities while 
helping patients adapt to their long-term needs (55). Rehabilitation 
interventions in the chronic stage often include community-based 
programs, which provide ongoing therapy and support. Advanced 
therapies such as robot-assisted therapy and virtual reality training are 
used to enhance motor skills and cognitive functions (108). Functional

electrical stimulation (FES) may be employed to improve muscle 
function, and mirror therapy can be used to create the illusion of 
movement in the affected limb (109). Cognitive rehabilitation 
activities are designed to improve memory, attention, and problem-
solving skills. Aerobic exercises and hydrotherapy are included to 
improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness (70). Music therapy 
can be beneficial for enhancing mood and cognitive functions (110). 
Long-term psychological support is crucial for helping patients adjust 
to their new normal and maintain motivation for continued 
recovery (111).
5 Acute management and 
rehabilitation
In the critical phase immediately following a stroke, the imperative 
is to promptly implement rehabilitation initiatives tailored to address 
immediate needs and initiate the recovery process. This phase is 
characterized by a dual focus on immediate rehabilitation strategies 
and addressing acute medical requirements. Acute management in 
stroke rehabilitation refers to the immediate interventions and care 
provided after the initial medical stabilization of a stroke patient, 
typically within the first few days to weeks following the stroke. This 
phase is distinct from emergency medical care and focuses on 
beginning the rehabilitation process to optimize recovery and prevent 
complications (40). After the initial emergency treatment, which aims 
to stabilize the patient and address life-threatening issues, acute 
management begins to initiate the rehabilitation journey. The goal 
during this phase is to start therapies that can enhance neurological 
recovery, improve functional outcomes, and set the stage for long-
term rehabilitation (112). This involves a multidisciplinary approach, 
including neurologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, 
speech therapists, and other healthcare professionals working together 
to develop a comprehensive care plan (101).
Continuous monitoring of neurological status and vital signs is 
crucial for detecting any signs of deterioration or complications such 
as recurrent strokes, infections, or cardiac issues. Adjustments to 
medication regimens and treatments are made based on the patient’s 
evolving condition (113). Initiating gentle physical activities and 
mobilization as soon as the patient is medically stable is essential. 
Early mobilization helps prevent complications like deep vein 
thrombosis, muscle atrophy, and joint contractures. Physical therapists 
work with patients to perform passive and active range of motion 
exercises, bed mobility exercises, and, when possible, supported 
standing and walking activities (114). Occupational therapists focus 
on helping patients regain their ability to perform daily activities. This 
includes exercises and interventions designed to improve motor skills, 
coordination, and cognitive functions necessary for tasks such as 
dressing, eating, and personal hygiene (115). For patients experiencing 
aphasia or dysphagia, speech therapists conduct assessments and 
provide targeted therapies to improve communication and swallowing 
abilities. This is critical to ensure that patients can safely consume food 
and liquids, thus reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonia (116). 
Addressing the psychological impact of a stroke is a key component 
of acute management. Mental health professionals provide counseling 
and support to help patients and their families cope with the emotional 
aftermath of a stroke. This support can help in reducing anxiety and 
depression, fostering a positive outlook towards rehabilitation (14). 
Proactive measures are taken to prevent secondary complications, 
including managing risk factors for recurrent strokes, such as 
hypertension and diabetes, ensuring proper nutrition, and maintaining 
skin integrity to prevent pressure ulcers (117). Thus, The primary 
objectives of acute management in stroke rehabilitation are to stabilize 
the patient’s medical condition, initiate rehabilitation therapies to 
enhance recovery, prevent secondary complications such as infections, 
thromboembolic events, and muscle wasting, provide psychological 
support to help patients and families adjust to the changes brought by 
the stroke, and establish a foundation for the subsequent stages of 
rehabilitation. By addressing these aspects, acute management aims to 
maximize the potential for functional recovery and improve the 
overall quality of life for stroke patients in the critical early days 
following their stroke.
5.1 Early rehabilitation initiatives
In the crucial hours immediately after a stroke, the introduction 
of early rehabilitation initiatives holds profound significance. These 
pivotal interventions, instated within the initial 24 to 48 h following 
the stroke event, form the cornerstone of the recovery process (118). 
Their 
primary 
objectives 
encompass 
preventing 
potential 
complications, initiating the rehabilitation trajectory, and laying the 
essential groundwork for optimal recovery (119).
Passive range-of-motion exercises emerge as fundamental 
components even during the acute phase post-stroke. These gentle 
movements administered to the affected limbs serve as a safeguard, 
preserving joint flexibility and thwarting the onset of muscle 
contractures. This preventive measure is instrumental in mitigating 
the risks associated with long-term impairments that could impede 
the recovery process (120, 121). Early mobilization takes precedence 
as a pivotal strategy in acute rehabilitation. Encouraging and 
facilitating patients to engage in sitting exercises, standing movements, 
and, when feasible, undertaking short walks constitute early 
mobilization efforts (71). Beyond mitigating muscle deconditioning, 
these early mobilization initiatives significantly mitigate the likelihood 
of complications like deep vein thrombosis and pressure ulcers, 
essential for promoting a conducive environment for recovery (122, 
123). Sensory stimulation techniques, involving tactile, auditory, or 
visual stimulation, are employed to arouse and activate affected senses. 
This early engagement of the senses aims to jumpstart neural plasticity 
and sensory reawakening in the specific brain regions impacted by the 
stroke event (124, 125). While seemingly straightforward, these early 
rehabilitation initiatives wield a profound impact. Their 
implementation is consistently validated by research, underscoring 
their pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of recovery for 
stroke survivors.
5.2 Addressing mobility and functional 
impairments
In the acute phase of stroke rehabilitation, the focus sharply 
narrows to addressing mobility and functional impairments. This 
critical phase aims to reestablish lost capabilities, enhance balance, 
coordination, and restore independence in daily activities (Figure 2). 
Physiotherapy interventions form the backbone of efforts to regain

mobility. Gait training, strength-building exercises, and balance drills 
orchestrated by physiotherapists are instrumental in improving motor 
function. These specialized exercises and techniques, often 
personalized to the individual’s condition, actively work toward 
ameliorating gait abnormalities. The integration of assistive devices 
and adaptive strategies further facilitates safe and effective movement 
(126, 127). Occupational therapy takes center stage in reinstating 
functionality in ADLs. Occupational therapists guide patients through 
essential tasks, such as dressing, grooming, feeding, and home 
management. The focus lies in enabling patients to regain 
independence in these pivotal daily activities, promoting autonomy 
and self-sufficiency (128). Task-specific training, an integral 
component of acute rehabilitation, involves engaging patients in 
activities tailored precisely to their deficits. By replicating real-life 
situations, this method fosters neural reorganization and functional 
recovery. These activities, meticulously designed to confront the 
unique challenges posed by the stroke, play a pivotal role in retraining 
the brain and restoring lost functionalities (56, 129). This acute phase 
of rehabilitation, deeply rooted in tailored interventions and guided 
exercises, serves as the foundation upon which subsequent recovery 
efforts are built. By addressing mobility and functional impairments 
strategically, this phase contributes significantly to restoring 
independence and enhancing the quality of life for stroke 
survivors (87).
5.3 Integrating rehabilitation into acute 
care
Integrating rehabilitation seamlessly into acute care settings is a 
fundamental aspect of providing comprehensive stroke care. This 
integration involves merging rehabilitation strategies into the acute 
medical management plan, ensuring a cohesive approach to address 
immediate medical needs alongside rehabilitation goals (130). Early 
identification and team collaboration are pivotal in this integration. 
Identifying rehabilitation needs promptly and assembling a 
multidisciplinary team comprising neurologists, physiatrists, nurses, 
therapists, and social workers facilitates a comprehensive assessment. 
This collaborative effort allows for a simultaneous evaluation of 
rehabilitation requirements in tandem with acute medical 
interventions (131). Tailoring rehabilitation goals forms the 
cornerstone of the integrated approach. Setting specific, measurable, 
achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives is crucial. 
These objectives, personalized to the patient’s condition, aim to 
optimize functional recovery while concurrently addressing 
immediate medical concerns. This tailored framework for 
rehabilitation forms the bedrock of a responsive and dynamic 
rehabilitation plan (132). Continuous monitoring and adjustment of 
rehabilitation strategies are essential components of this integrated 
model. Continuous evaluation of the patient’s response to 
rehabilitation interventions enables real-time adjustments. This 
adaptive approach ensures that rehabilitation strategies remain 
responsive to the patient’s evolving needs and medical condition, 
fostering a flexible and patient-centric rehabilitation process (133, 
134). Integrating rehabilitation into acute care represents a paradigm 
shift, acknowledging the symbiotic relationship between immediate 
medical interventions and the imperative need for rehabilitative 
efforts. This holistic approach not only kickstarts the rehabilitation 
journey early on but also ensures a coordinated and comprehensive 
care plan for stroke survivors (19, 135).
6 Rehabilitation modalities
6.1 Physical therapy
Physical therapy (PT) stands as a cornerstone within stroke 
rehabilitation, encompassing a multifaceted approach aimed at restoring 
mobility, enhancing motor function, and mitigating physical 
impairments. It serves as an integral component throughout the 
continuum of stroke care, spanning from acute management to long-
term recovery (136, 137). Upon initial assessment, physical therapists

meticulously evaluate the individual’s functional abilities, motor 
impairments, and specific limitations resulting from the stroke. Based 
on this assessment, personalized rehabilitation plans are crafted, and 
tailored to address the unique needs and goals of each patient. These 
plans are dynamic, evolving with the patient’s progress and changing 
requirements (138, 139). Gait training assumes a crucial role in PT for 
stroke survivors, focusing on restoring and optimizing walking patterns.
Therapists employ various techniques, from treadmill-based 
training to over-ground walking practice, concentrating on improving 
balance, strength, and coordination (140). Advanced technologies 
such as robotic-assisted gait training or body-weight-supported 
treadmill training may be  utilized to augment the rehabilitation 
process. Emphasis is placed on re-establishing a safe and functional 
gait to enable increased independence in daily activities (141). PT 
interventions encompass a range of exercises designed to enhance 
muscle strength, flexibility, and coordination. Targeted exercises, 
customized to address specific muscle groups affected by the stroke, 
aid in motor recovery. Therapists utilize resistance training, functional 
activities, and neuromuscular re-education to promote muscle 
activation and facilitate movement in impaired limbs (142, 143). 
Therapists employ various balance exercises and proprioceptive 
activities to improve balance and coordination, essential for preventing 
falls and enabling functional mobility. These exercises often involve 
challenging the patient’s stability in a controlled environment to 
enhance balance reactions and postural control (144). Moreover, to 
mitigate the risk of secondary complications such as joint contractures 
and stiffness, therapists incorporate range-of-motion exercises. These 
gentle movements aim to preserve joint flexibility, prevent 
musculoskeletal issues, and facilitate ease of movement in affected 
limbs (145, 146). PT extends beyond clinical settings, encompassing 
functional training and home modification recommendations. 
Therapists collaborate with patients to simulate real-life scenarios, 
practicing activities crucial for daily living. Additionally, they provide 
guidance on adapting home environments and suggesting assistive 
devices and modifications to enhance accessibility and safety within 
the home setting (147, 148). Physical Therapy, as a core element of 
stroke rehabilitation, not only targets physical impairments but also 
promotes functional independence, enabling individuals to regain 
confidence and improve their overall quality of life following a stroke.
6.2 Occupational therapy
Occupational therapy (OT) within stroke rehabilitation is a 
pivotal modality focused on restoring independence in daily activities, 
re-establishing functional abilities, and promoting engagement in 
meaningful life roles. Tailored to each individual’s needs and goals, OT 
interventions span various domains to facilitate a smoother transition 
from impairment to autonomy (149, 150). Occupational therapists 
conduct comprehensive assessments to gauge the impact of stroke on 
an individual’s ability to perform daily tasks. These assessments help 
formulate personalized rehabilitation plans, targeting specific deficits 
in ADLs, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), work-related 
tasks, and leisure activities (151, 152). OT interventions primarily 
revolve around retraining and adapting ADLs. Therapists employ task-
oriented training to facilitate independence in self-care activities such 
as grooming, bathing, dressing, toileting, and feeding. Adaptive 
strategies, environmental modifications, and the use of assistive 
devices are integrated to maximize functional independence and 
participation in daily routines (153, 154). Recovery of upper limb 
function is a key focus within OT. Therapists utilize exercises targeting 
hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, and dexterity. Techniques 
like constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), mirror therapy, 
and graded motor imagery are employed to encourage the use of the 
affected limb and improve its function (155). OT extends its scope to 
support community reintegration and vocational pursuits. Therapists 
assist individuals in transitioning back into community life by 
providing guidance on accessing community resources, public 
transportation, and social participation. Vocational rehabilitation 
focuses on adapting work environments, modifying job tasks, and 
exploring adaptive technologies to facilitate a return to work or 
engagement in meaningful productive activities (156, 157).
Occupational therapists address cognitive impairments and 
sensory deficits that impact daily functioning. Strategies are 
implemented to improve attention, memory, executive functions, and 
problem-solving skills necessary for effective task performance. 
Sensory integration techniques help individuals process sensory 
information effectively, enhancing their ability to engage in 
meaningful activities (158). Collaborating with individuals and their 
families, OTs recommend modifications in the home environment to 
promote safety, accessibility, and independence. Suggestions for 
adaptive equipment and assistive devices are provided to facilitate ease 
in performing tasks and to compensate for functional limitations 
(159). OT, as an integral part of stroke rehabilitation, focuses on 
enabling individuals to regain independence and participation in 
activities essential to their daily lives, fostering a sense of 
accomplishment and self-sufficiency post-stroke.
6.3 Speech and language therapy
Speech and language therapy (SLT) is a critical component of 
stroke rehabilitation, encompassing a diverse range of interventions 
tailored to address communication and swallowing difficulties. These 
interventions aim to restore functional communication abilities and 
ensure safe swallowing, significantly impacting an individual’s quality 
of life post-stroke (39). Speech-language pathologists conduct 
comprehensive assessments to evaluate the extent of communication 
impairments and swallowing difficulties post-stroke. These 
assessments form the basis for individualized treatment plans that 
address specific deficits and goals (160). SLT interventions for speech 
articulation aim to improve clarity, intelligibility, and pronunciation. 
Therapists utilize exercises targeting oral-motor coordination, breath 
control, and vocal exercises to enhance speech production (161). 
Techniques such as articulation drills, repetition exercises, and 
tongue-strengthening exercises aid in improving speech intelligibility 
(162). Language therapy focuses on improving language 
comprehension and expression abilities. Therapists employ activities 
like word-finding exercises, storytelling, and comprehension tasks to 
enhance language skills. Strategies aim to rebuild vocabulary, sentence 
construction, and overall language fluency (163).
SLT addresses cognitive-communication deficits resulting 
from stroke, including impairments in problem-solving, reasoning, 
and social communication skills. Therapists use tasks such as 
conversation practice, problem-solving scenarios, and pragmatic 
language exercises to improve overall communication abilities 

Li et al.

(164). Swallowing difficulties, known as dysphagia, are common 
post-stroke. SLT interventions target these issues to ensure safe 
and efficient swallowing. Therapists employ various exercises to 
improve muscle coordination and swallowing reflexes (165). 
Strategies like modified diets, swallowing maneuvers, and postural 
adjustments are introduced to minimize the risk of aspiration and 
enhance swallowing function (166). For individuals with severe 
communication 
impairments, 
SLT 
involves 
introducing 
augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies. 
These may include communication boards, speech-generating 
devices, or apps that enable individuals to express themselves 
effectively, compensating for speech difficulties (167). SLT involves 
educating families and caregivers about communication strategies 
and techniques to facilitate effective communication with the 
individual post-stroke. Training in supportive communication 
approaches fosters better understanding and interaction within the 
home environment (168). SLT, as a crucial element in stroke 
rehabilitation, aims to restore communication abilities and ensure 
safe swallowing, empowering individuals to engage more fully in 
social interactions and daily activities. A systematic review and 
meta-analysis by Chiaramonte and Vecchio (169) demonstrated 
the efficacy of speech rehabilitation in treating dysarthria among 
stroke survivors. The study observed notable enhancements in 
essential acoustic parameters, including alternating and sequential 
motion rates (AMR and SMR) and maximum phonation time, 
post-speech therapy. These parameters are vital for evaluating and 
managing dysarthria as they are directly linked to motor control 
necessary for speech production. Utilizing tools such as the Multi-
Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP) and PRAAT software for 
acoustic analysis enables an objective measurement of 
improvements in patients’ speech intelligibility and supports 
targeted therapeutic interventions. Notably, techniques that 
increase jaw movement, promote louder speech, and expand vowel 
space area have been found to significantly enhance speech clarity 
and intelligibility. Incorporating these detailed assessments and 
targeted interventions into SLT programs can lead to more 
effective 
rehabilitation 
outcomes, 
thereby 
improving 
communication abilities and overall quality of life for stroke 
survivors (169).
6.4 Cognitive rehabilitation
Cognitive rehabilitation plays a vital role in stroke recovery, 
focusing on addressing cognitive impairments such as memory 
deficits, attention issues, and executive function difficulties. This 
multifaceted approach aims to restore and enhance cognitive abilities, 
ultimately promoting independence and improving the individual’s 
quality of life post-stroke (170). Cognitive rehabilitation begins with 
a comprehensive assessment of cognitive functions post-stroke. 
Therapists evaluate memory, attention, problem-solving, and 
executive function to identify specific deficits. Based on this 
assessment, tailored interventions are designed to address individual 
needs (88). Therapists employ various memory-enhancing techniques 
to improve memory recall and retention. These strategies may include 
mnemonic techniques, spaced-repetition exercises, memory games, 
and the use of memory aids like calendars or notebooks. By practicing 
memory recall, individuals can strengthen their ability to retain and 
retrieve information (171, 172). Interventions targeting attention 
deficits involve exercises that aim to improve different aspects of 
attention, including sustained attention, selective attention, and 
divided attention (173). Therapists utilize tasks requiring sustained 
focus, attentional drills, and multitasking activities to enhance 
attentional abilities and reduce distractibility (174). Cognitive 
rehabilitation addresses deficits in executive functions such as 
planning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Therapists employ 
tasks that require organization, time management, and prioritization 
to enhance cognitive flexibility and executive control. Strategies focus 
on breaking tasks into manageable steps and implementing problem-
solving techniques (175). For individuals experiencing cognitive-
communication deficits, therapists introduce strategies that enhance 
communication effectiveness. Techniques may involve using visual 
aids, 
simplifying 
information, 
and 
employing 
structured 
communication methods to aid comprehension and expression (176). 
Interventions extend to practicing functional tasks relevant to daily 
life. Therapists guide individuals through activities that replicate real-
world scenarios, such as meal planning, managing finances, or using 
public transportation. Task-specific training helps individuals adapt 
to challenges they might encounter in their daily routines (177). 
Therapists collaborate with individuals to develop compensatory 
strategies and routines to cope with cognitive deficits. Additionally, 
recommendations for environmental modifications, such as 
organizing living spaces or implementing memory aids, assist 
individuals in managing daily tasks more effectively (178). Cognitive 
rehabilitation within stroke rehabilitation focuses on empowering 
individuals to adapt and compensate for cognitive impairments, 
enhancing their ability to perform daily activities independently and 
facilitating a smoother reintegration into their daily routines 
post-stroke.
6.5 Integration of proprioceptive training, 
dual-task exercises, and goal-oriented 
activities in stroke rehabilitation
Stroke rehabilitation aims to restore balance and autonomy in 
ADL through a variety of targeted exercises. Proprioceptive training, 
which focuses on improving body position awareness, is crucial for 
enhancing balance and coordination. Techniques such as balance 
boards, stability exercises, and sensory re-education are employed to 
stimulate proprioceptive feedback, promoting better motor control 
and reducing fall risk (105).
Dual-task exercises, which require patients to perform a motor 
task while simultaneously engaging in a cognitive task, have shown 
significant benefits in stroke recovery. These exercises not only 
improve physical function but also enhance cognitive processing, 
which is often impaired in stroke survivors. For instance, walking 
while counting backward or performing a physical task while 
responding to questions helps integrate cognitive and motor skills, 
leading to improved overall function (179, 180).
Goal-oriented exercises involve setting specific, measurable, 
achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that align with 
the patient’s individual needs and capabilities. These exercises foster 
motivation and adherence to the rehabilitation program (181). By 
focusing on personal goals, such as dressing independently or walking 
a certain distance, patients are more likely to stay engaged and 

Li et al.

frontiersin.org
committed to their recovery process. Research has shown that goal-
setting significantly improves outcomes in stroke rehabilitation by 
providing clear targets and enhancing patient autonomy (182).
Incorporating proprioceptive training, dual-task exercises, and 
goal-oriented exercises into stroke rehabilitation programs offers a 
comprehensive approach to improving balance and autonomy in 
ADL. Proprioceptive training enhances sensory feedback and 
coordination, dual-task exercises improve multitasking abilities and 
overall functional performance, and goal-oriented exercises ensure 
that rehabilitation is relevant and motivating for the patient. Together, 
these interventions address both the physical and cognitive challenges 
faced by stroke survivors, leading to more effective rehabilitation 
outcomes. Future research should continue to explore the optimal 
strategies for integrating these approaches to maximize their benefits 
for stroke patients.
6.6 Botulinum toxin injection in 
post-stroke spasticity
Spasticity resulting from strokes poses considerable hurdles to 
motor function and daily tasks for those affected. Botulinum toxin type 
A (BoNT-A) injection has become the preferred treatment for localized 
spasticity, especially among stroke survivors, owing to its established 
effectiveness, reversible nature, and minimal risk of complications. The 
treatment of upper motor neuron syndrome, marked by spasticity and 
excessive muscle activity, requires strategies to alleviate spasticity-related 
issues and forestall further complications (183). BoNT-A treatment has 
become a crucial therapeutic approach, especially for localized spasticity 
in individuals who have had strokes. Research exploring the 
effectiveness of elevated doses of BoNT-A (exceeding usual guidelines) 
in post-stroke spasticity has shown encouraging outcomes (184). 
Despite initial worries about potential systemic side effects, most 
patients encountered substantial decreases in spasticity without 
encountering severe issues (185, 186). Although elevated doses of 
BoNT-A demonstrated effectiveness in spasticity reduction, instances 
of adverse effects, including contralateral weakness and systemic 
complications, were observed in certain cases (187). It is essential to 
carefully assess injection frequency, dilution volumes, and the possibility 
of antibody formation to minimize the likelihood of adverse events 
(188). The results highlight the efficacy of elevated doses of BoNT-A in 
managing post-stroke spasticity, especially in scenarios involving 
significant muscle hypertonia (189). Nonetheless, meticulous patient 
selection, accurate injection methodologies, and vigilant monitoring for 
adverse effects are crucial to enhancing treatment efficacy and 
upholding patient well-being. Research findings indicate the potential 
benefits of increased BoNT-A doses in mitigating spasticity and 
enhancing functional recovery among stroke survivors (190). Additional 
investigations are needed to clarify the most effective dosing regimens, 
improve injection methodologies, and assess the long-term safety and 
effectiveness in broader patient populations.
7 Technological advances in 
rehabilitation
Advancements in technology have revolutionized stroke 
rehabilitation, and one prominent innovation is the integration of 
robotics. Robotic-assisted rehabilitation systems offer a promising 
avenue to enhance motor recovery, functional outcomes, and patient 
engagement in stroke rehabilitation.
7.1 Robotics in stroke rehabilitation
Technological advancements, particularly in robotics, have 
dramatically transformed the landscape of stroke rehabilitation, 
ushering in innovative approaches to enhance motor recovery, 
functional abilities, and overall quality of life for individuals affected 
by stroke (191). In upper limb rehabilitation, robotics play a pivotal 
role by offering precise and intensive therapy through devices like 
exoskeletons and end-effector robots. These devices provide tailored 
exercises, guiding patients through movements aimed at improving 
motor control, strength, and the range of motion in affected arms and 
hands. This focused approach allows therapists to customize 
rehabilitation plans based on specific impairments, fostering more 
targeted and impactful interventions (192, 193). Gait training, crucial 
for restoring walking abilities post-stroke, benefits significantly from 
robotic systems. Exoskeletons and treadmill-based robots assist 
individuals by providing mechanical support and guidance during 
walking exercises (194). These devices help in relearning proper gait 
patterns, correcting asymmetries, and improving balance and stride 
length. The real-time feedback offered by these systems enhances 
motor learning, aiding in the retraining of gait patterns (195). One of 
the significant advantages of robotic-assisted therapy lies in its ability 
to offer task-specific training. Therapists can replicate real-life 
activities through these systems, allowing stroke survivors to practice 
movements required for daily tasks. This tailored approach fosters 
neuroplasticity, encouraging the brain to adapt and rewire neural 
connections to facilitate improved movement patterns (196).
Additionally, these robotic systems provide therapists with real-
time feedback and monitoring capabilities. They track performance 
metrics such as range of motion, force exertion, and movement 
accuracy. This data empowers therapists to assess progress accurately, 
modify therapy intensity, and customize treatment plans according to 
individual responses, ensuring optimized rehabilitation outcomes 
(197). The advent of portable and user-friendly robotic devices has 
extended the reach of rehabilitation beyond clinical settings. Home-
based rehabilitation using these systems enables stroke survivors to 
continue their therapy under professional guidance. This continuity 
in therapy enhances accessibility and adherence to treatment, 
contributing to sustained recovery (198). Furthermore, the integration 
of adaptive algorithms powered by machine learning and artificial 
intelligence tailors rehabilitation interventions to individual needs. 
These algorithms analyze patient responses in real-time, allowing for 
adjustments in therapy parameters to maximize the effectiveness of 
rehabilitation protocols (199).
The interactive nature of robotic technologies in stroke 
rehabilitation engages patients through gamified exercises and 
interactive interfaces. This enhanced engagement motivates 
individuals to actively participate in therapy sessions, promoting 
adherence and ultimately contributing to improved outcomes and 
functional recovery (200). However, it is essential to acknowledge 
certain limitations associated with the use of robotics in rehabilitation. 
While robotics offer precise and intensive therapy, some challenges 
need to be addressed. One such limitation is the cost involved in 

Li et al.
10.3389/fneur.2024.1402729
Frontiers in Neurology
11
frontiersin.org
acquiring and maintaining robotic systems, which may pose financial 
barriers to widespread adoption. Moreover, in certain usage protocols, 
such as assistive modes, there is a risk of decreased effort or attention 
from patients during training sessions. This decrease in engagement 
could potentially impact the effectiveness of rehabilitation outcomes. 
Therefore, it is crucial for therapists to carefully monitor patient 
participation and motivation levels during robotic-assisted therapy to 
ensure optimal results (201–204). Despite these challenges, the benefits 
of robotic systems in stroke rehabilitation are considerable. Overall, 
while acknowledging the limitations, robotics in stroke rehabilitation 
represent a promising frontier in enhancing motor recovery and 
functional independence. These advancements pave the way for more 
personalized, engaging, and effective interventions, offering hope for 
improved rehabilitation outcomes for stroke survivors.
7.2 Virtual reality and augmented reality 
applications
Technological advancements in virtual reality (VR) and 
augmented reality (AR) have profoundly impacted the landscape of 
stroke rehabilitation, offering immersive, interactive, and personalized 
interventions that significantly contribute to the recovery process (205).
Within stroke rehabilitation, VR therapy creates computer-
generated environments that simulate real-life scenarios. These 
environments immerse patients in interactive exercises tailored to 
their specific rehabilitation needs. VR-based tasks focus on improving 
motor functions, cognitive abilities, and balance (206). For instance, 
individuals can engage in upper limb exercises or practice balance-
related activities within a controlled virtual setting. By replicating real-
world scenarios, VR therapy stimulates neuroplasticity and motor 
learning, aiding in functional recovery (207).
Augmented reality (AR) enhances rehabilitation by overlaying 
digital information onto the real world. AR applications provide real-
time visual cues or instructions during exercises, aiding stroke 
survivors in performing movements accurately and safely (208). For 
example, a stroke survivor practicing arm movements may receive 
visual guidance overlaid onto their affected limb, promoting correct 
positioning and motion execution. AR enhances spatial awareness and 
motor planning, facilitating better task performance (209).
In cognitive rehabilitation, VR and AR interventions extend 
beyond physical movements to address deficits in attention, memory, 
and executive function. Gamified tasks and simulations challenge 
cognitive skills, stimulating neural adaptation and functional 
improvement (210). These technologies offer engaging and interactive 
cognitive exercises, fostering mental stimulation and promoting 
cognitive recovery post-stroke (211). Moreover, VR and AR 
applications allow stroke survivors to simulate functional tasks in a 
controlled virtual environment. Patients can practice activities such as 
cooking, shopping, or navigating public spaces within the safety of a 
virtual setting. These simulations offer a platform for individuals to 
relearn and regain confidence in performing daily tasks, preparing 
them for real-life scenarios and promoting independence (212, 213).
However, it is crucial to recognize that the applicability of VR 
therapy may vary among stroke survivors. Factors such as cognitive 
abilities, physical impairments, and individual preferences need to 
be considered when determining the suitability of VR interventions 
for a particular patient. While VR therapy holds tremendous potential 
for many individuals, it may not be suitable for everyone. Therefore, a 
comprehensive assessment on a case-by-case basis is essential to 
ensure that VR therapy is appropriately tailored to meet the unique 
needs and capabilities of each stroke survivor (214, 215).
Despite the need for individualized assessment, VR and AR 
applications have demonstrated significant potential to enhance 
motivation and engagement during rehabilitation sessions. The 
immersive nature of these interventions captures individuals’ 
attention, encouraging active participation in therapy. The interactive 
and enjoyable aspects of VR and AR contribute to increased adherence 
and consistency in rehabilitation exercises, positively impacting 
recovery outcomes. Overall, while recognizing the transformative 
impact of VR and AR technologies on stroke rehabilitation, it is 
essential to assess their applicability on a case-by-case basis. By 
conducting individualized assessments and tailoring interventions to 
meet the unique needs of each patient, therapists can maximize the 
effectiveness of VR and AR applications in promoting motor, 
cognitive, and functional recovery for stroke survivors (56, 216, 217).
7.3 Neurostimulation techniques
Technological advancements in neurostimulation techniques have 
emerged as promising interventions within the realm of stroke 
rehabilitation, seeking to modulate neural activity, induce neuroplastic 
changes, and ultimately enhance recovery outcomes for individuals 
impacted by stroke.
7.3.1 Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stands as a 
non-invasive neurostimulation technique used in stroke 
rehabilitation to modulate cortical excitability. It involves 
generating brief magnetic pulses through a coil placed over specific 
areas of the scalp, creating an electromagnetic field that penetrates 
the skull and influences neural activity in the underlying brain 
regions (218, 219). In stroke rehabilitation, repetitive TMS (rTMS) 
aims to induce changes in cortical excitability by delivering repeated 
magnetic pulses to targeted brain areas associated with motor 
function. By adjusting the frequency, intensity, and duration of 
these pulses, clinicians can modulate neural activity and promote 
neuroplasticity (220). The primary goal of TMS in stroke recovery 
is to facilitate motor relearning and functional improvement in 
affected limbs. By targeting specific cortical regions related to 
motor control and movement execution, rTMS aims to promote 
neural reorganization, facilitating the formation of new neural 
connections or enhancing existing ones. This process supports 
motor learning and reacquisition of motor skills affected by stroke-
induced impairments (221, 222). Moreover, TMS is utilized to 
assess and map cortical excitability and the integrity of motor 
pathways in stroke survivors. By evaluating the response of motor 
cortices to TMS pulses, clinicians gain insights into the extent of 
cortical reorganization, helping to tailor and optimize rehabilitation 
strategies for individual patients (223). TMS holds promise as an 
adjunctive therapy in stroke rehabilitation, potentially enhancing 
outcomes by promoting neuroplastic changes, aiding in motor 
recovery, and improving functional abilities in affected individuals. 
Continued research and refinement of TMS protocols offer 
significant potential for optimizing its application in stroke

rehabilitation, contributing to improved recovery and quality of life 
for stroke survivors.
7.3.2 Transcranial direct current stimulation
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive 
neurostimulation technique used in stroke rehabilitation to modulate 
cortical excitability. It involves delivering low-intensity electrical 
currents via electrodes placed on the scalp, aiming to influence 
neuronal activity in targeted brain areas (224). In the context of stroke 
recovery, tDCS seeks to promote neuroplastic changes by modulating 
cortical excitability in regions affected by the stroke-induced 
impairments (225). By applying a continuous low electrical current to 
specific cortical areas, tDCS aims to either enhance or inhibit neuronal 
firing patterns, ultimately influencing the brain’s ability to reorganize 
and adapt (226). The primary objective of tDCS in stroke rehabilitation 
is to facilitate neuroplasticity and enhance motor recovery. By 
modulating cortical excitability in motor-related brain regions, tDCS 
aims to promote the reorganization of neural networks, aiding in 
motor relearning and the restoration of motor function in affected 
limbs (227). Additionally, tDCS protocols can vary, employing 
different electrode montages and stimulation parameters to target 
specific cortical areas associated with motor function. The modulation 
of cortical excitability using tDCS may facilitate motor learning 
processes and the reacquisition of motor skills impacted by stroke-
related impairments (228). Moreover, tDCS is considered a safe and 
well-tolerated technique, often used in conjunction with other 
rehabilitation approaches. Its non-invasive nature and potential to 
induce neuroplastic changes make it an attractive adjunctive therapy 
in stroke rehabilitation (229). Continued research into optimal tDCS 
parameters, such as electrode placement, stimulation duration, and 
intensity, holds promise for refining its application in stroke recovery. 
As the understanding of tDCS mechanisms grows, it offers substantial 
potential to enhance motor recovery outcomes and improve functional 
abilities in stroke survivors.
7.3.3 Functional electrical stimulation
Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitative 
technique employed in stroke rehabilitation to activate paralyzed or 
weakened muscles by delivering controlled electrical impulses to 
peripheral nerves or muscle groups. It aims to restore voluntary 
movement, improve muscle strength, and facilitate motor relearning 
in affected limbs (229). In stroke survivors experiencing motor 
impairments, FES utilizes electrodes placed on the skin’s surface or 
implanted directly on muscles to deliver electrical stimulation (230). 
This stimulation generates muscle contractions, facilitating 
movements that may be difficult or impossible due to stroke-induced 
paralysis or weakness (231). The primary goal of FES in stroke 
rehabilitation is to support motor recovery and functional 
improvement. By stimulating targeted muscles or muscle groups, FES 
assists in muscle strengthening, preventing muscle atrophy, and 
enhancing muscle performance. This electrical stimulation aids in 
restoring voluntary movement patterns, facilitating motor control, 
and promoting the relearning of motor skills necessary for activities 
of daily living (232). FES applications can vary based on the specific 
rehabilitation goals and affected muscle groups. For instance, in upper 
limb rehabilitation, FES may target muscles involved in hand grasping 
or arm movement, aiding in functional tasks such as reaching or 
grasping objects. In lower limb rehabilitation, FES can assist with 
walking by stimulating leg muscles to facilitate stepping 
movements (233).
Furthermore, FES can be  integrated into functional tasks or 
exercises, enabling stroke survivors to actively engage in movements 
with the assistance of electrical stimulation. This integration of FES 
with rehabilitation exercises promotes motor learning, supports task-
specific training, and enhances functional recovery (234).
However, it is important to acknowledge that various studies have 
reported concerns regarding the discomfort associated with wearing 
FES instruments for prolonged periods. Additionally, prolonged FES 
usage may lead to muscle fatigue and decrease responsiveness, 
potentially affecting its effectiveness in stroke rehabilitation. Muscle 
fatigue presents a significant challenge associated with FES, imposing 
limitations on therapy duration and compromising its potential 
benefits (235). Furthermore, the effectiveness of conventional 
waveform modalities varies. These conventional waveforms lack 
guidance from neural movement control mechanisms, potentially 
reducing their efficacy in restoring movement (236, 237). Despite 
these concerns, strategies can be  implemented to mitigate these 
drawbacks. For instance, proper electrode placement and adjustment 
of stimulation parameters can help optimize comfort and minimize 
muscle fatigue. Moreover, incorporating regular breaks during FES 
sessions and integrating FES with other rehabilitation modalities can 
help prevent overuse-related issues and enhance overall treatment 
outcomes. Recently, there has been interest in utilizing muscle 
synergy-driven FES waveforms, which have demonstrated 
effectiveness in restoring muscle function among stroke patients (238).
Furthermore, FES can be  integrated into functional tasks or 
exercises, enabling stroke survivors to actively engage in movements 
with the assistance of electrical stimulation. This integration of FES 
with rehabilitation exercises promotes motor learning, supports task-
specific training, and enhances functional recovery (234). The use of 
FES in stroke rehabilitation is well-established and considered a safe 
and effective adjunctive therapy. It complements other rehabilitation 
strategies, contributing to comprehensive treatment plans aimed at 
improving motor function and restoring independence in daily 
activities (239). Continued advancements in FES technology and its 
integration with other rehabilitation approaches hold significant 
promise for optimizing motor recovery outcomes, enhancing 
functional abilities, and improving the quality of life for individuals 
affected by stroke.
7.3.4 Implantable devices (brain-computer 
interfaces)
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent cutting-edge 
implantable devices used in stroke rehabilitation to establish a direct 
communication link between the brain and external devices, aiming 
to restore motor function and enhance functional independence 
(240). In the context of stroke recovery, BCIs decode neural signals 
from the brain, allowing individuals to control external devices or 
prosthetics directly through their thoughts (241). This technology 
bypasses damaged neural pathways, enabling stroke survivors with 
severe motor impairments to interact with their environment or 
perform tasks that were previously compromised due to stroke-
induced limitations (242). BCIs typically involve surgically implanting 
electrodes or sensors directly into the brain’s motor cortex or on the 
surface of the brain. These electrodes detect neural signals related to 
motor intentions or commands (243, 244). Through advanced

algorithms and signal processing techniques, these neural signals are 
decoded into commands that can control external devices, such as 
robotic arms, computer interfaces, or assistive technology (245). The 
primary objective of BCIs in stroke rehabilitation is to restore motor 
function and improve independence in individuals with severe motor 
impairments (246). By interpreting neural signals and translating 
them into control commands for external devices, BCIs enable 
individuals to execute movements or interact with their environment 
based on their intention, bypassing the physical limitations caused by 
stroke-induced motor deficits (245). BCIs hold immense potential in 
stroke recovery by providing individuals with a means to regain 
control over their movements and perform tasks that were previously 
challenging or impossible (245). This technology aims to enhance 
functional abilities, promote independence in daily activities, and 
improve the overall quality of life for stroke survivors with severe 
motor impairments. Ongoing developments in BCI technology, such 
as improving signal accuracy, enhancing decoding algorithms, and 
refining implantation techniques, offer promising prospects for 
further optimizing their application in stroke rehabilitation. As 
research progresses, BCIs hold substantial promise for revolutionizing 
rehabilitation practices and empowering stroke survivors to regain 
functional abilities and independence.
8 Challenges and opportunities in 
stroke rehabilitation
8.1 Lack of standardized timing for stroke 
rehabilitation initiation
One of the challenges in stroke rehabilitation is the absence of 
standardized guidelines for the timing of initiating rehabilitation 
programs. The timing of rehabilitation can significantly influence 
recovery outcomes, yet there is considerable variability in clinical 
practice regarding when to start specific rehabilitation interventions.
The initiation of rehabilitation can vary based on several factors, 
including the type of stroke, the severity of the stroke, patient 
comorbidities, and the specific rehabilitation protocols being used. 
Some rehabilitation programs advocate for early initiation, typically 
within the first few days after a stroke, while others may recommend 
waiting until the patient is more medically stable. Early rehabilitation, 
which often begins within the first 24 to 48 h after stroke onset, aims 
to capitalize on the brain’s heightened plasticity during the acute 
phase. This approach can help prevent complications such as muscle 
atrophy and joint contractures and can improve functional outcomes 
(101). However, it requires careful monitoring to avoid overexertion 
and other risks. In contrast, some protocols suggest delaying the start 
of intensive rehabilitation until the subacute phase, typically 1 to 
2 weeks post-stroke. This delay allows for better medical stabilization 
and assessment of the patient’s overall condition (247). Furthermore, 
the lack of standardized timing affects various rehabilitation programs 
differently. Physical therapy and early mobilization are often 
encouraged, but the intensity and type of exercises may vary based on 
the patient’s initial response and stability (123). The timing for starting 
occupational therapy can depend on the patient’s ability to participate 
in ADLs and cognitive readiness (248). Moreover, the initiation of 
speech and language therapy may be  contingent on the patient’s 
neurological status and ability to engage in communication exercises 
(101). The variability in the initiation of rehabilitation programs 
underscores the need for standardized guidelines that can provide a 
framework for clinicians. Developing such guidelines would involve 
comprehensive research to determine the optimal timing for different 
rehabilitation interventions. Additionally, these guidelines should 
consider individual patient factors, such as age, comorbidities, and 
stroke severity. Collaboration among healthcare providers is also 
essential to establish a consensus on best practices. Thus, Addressing 
the lack of standardized timing for stroke rehabilitation initiation is 
crucial for improving patient outcomes. Establishing evidence-based 
guidelines can help ensure that patients receive timely and effective 
rehabilitation, tailored to their specific needs and conditions. Future 
research should focus on identifying the most effective timelines for 
various rehabilitation interventions to create a standardized approach 
that can be widely adopted in clinical practice.
8.2 Access to rehabilitation services
Access to comprehensive rehabilitation services remains a 
substantial challenge in stroke care. Geographical disparities, 
especially in rural or remote areas, often limit access to specialized 
rehabilitation centers and skilled healthcare professionals (249). 
Moreover, socioeconomic factors and financial constraints can impede 
access to rehabilitation, particularly for individuals with limited 
insurance coverage or financial resources (249). Addressing these 
challenges requires innovative approaches, such as telemedicine and 
mobile health solutions, to extend rehabilitation services beyond 
traditional clinical settings (250). Tele-rehabilitation programs, 
leveraging technology for remote assessment and therapy delivery, 
have shown promise in improving access to rehabilitation for 
underserved populations (251). Initiatives promoting community-
based rehabilitation and partnerships with local healthcare providers 
play a crucial role in bridging the access gap, and ensuring equitable 
delivery of stroke rehabilitation services (252).
8.3 Stroke-related infections during 
hospitalization
Stroke patients are particularly vulnerable to infections during 
their hospital stay due to a combination of factors such as immobility, 
impaired swallowing (dysphagia), weakened immune function, and 
the need for invasive procedures (253). These infections can 
significantly impact patient outcomes, prolong hospitalization, and 
increase healthcare costs. The most common infections encountered 
during hospitalization of stroke patients include pneumonia, urinary 
tract infections (UTIs), and bloodstream infections (254).
Pneumonia is one of the most frequent complications in stroke 
patients, particularly those with dysphagia, which is difficulty in 
swallowing. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when food, liquid, or saliva 
is inhaled into the lungs instead of being swallowed into the 
esophagus. This risk is heightened in patients who have had a stroke 
because the neurological impairment can affect the muscles involved 
in swallowing (255). Pneumonia in stroke patients can lead to severe 
respiratory issues and prolong recovery times (256). Preventative 
measures include early assessment and management of swallowing 
difficulties, the use of thickened liquids, and positioning strategies 

Li et al.

during feeding to reduce the risk of aspiration. Urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) are another common complication in stroke patients. Factors 
contributing to UTIs include the use of urinary catheters, which are 
often necessary due to incontinence or mobility issues post-stroke. 
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a significant 
concern because they can lead to more serious systemic infections, 
including sepsis (257). Preventing UTIs involves careful catheter care, 
minimizing catheter use, and removing catheters as soon as possible. 
Hydration, proper hygiene, and regular monitoring for signs of 
infection are also crucial. Bloodstream infections, including central 
line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), can occur in stroke 
patients, especially those who require intravenous therapy or other 
invasive procedures. These infections can escalate into sepsis, a life-
threatening response to infection, further complicating the patient’s 
recovery (258). To prevent bloodstream infections, healthcare 
providers must adhere to strict aseptic techniques during the insertion 
and maintenance of central lines and other invasive devices. Regular 
monitoring and prompt treatment of any signs of infection 
are essential.
Preventing infections in stroke patients requires a comprehensive 
and proactive approach. Encouraging early movement and physical 
therapy to reduce the risks associated with prolonged immobility, such 
as pneumonia and pressure ulcers. Mobilization helps improve 
circulation and lung function, reducing the likelihood of infections 
(256). Performing timely evaluations of swallowing ability to identify 
patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Interventions might include 
dietary modifications, swallowing exercises, and the use of thickened 
liquids (255). Implementing protocols to ensure the proper use and 
maintenance of urinary catheters. This includes adhering to guidelines 
for catheter insertion, ensuring cleanliness, and removing catheters as 
soon as they are no longer necessary to reduce the risk of CAUTIs 
(257). Promoting stringent hand hygiene practices among healthcare 
providers and visitors to minimize the transmission of pathogens in 
the hospital environment (258). Using antibiotics judiciously to 
prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and reduce 
the risk of adverse reactions. This involves selecting the appropriate 
antibiotic and duration of treatment based on the specific infection 
and patient condition (257). Infections are a significant risk for stroke 
patients during hospitalization, contributing to higher morbidity and 
mortality rates. By implementing targeted preventive measures and 
closely monitoring patients, healthcare providers can reduce the 
incidence of infections and improve overall outcomes. Effective 
infection control practices are essential to ensure the best possible 
recovery for stroke patients.
8.4 Tailoring rehabilitation to individual 
needs
The heterogeneity of stroke-related impairments and the diverse 
needs of stroke survivors pose challenges in tailoring rehabilitation 
interventions. Standardized approaches may not adequately address 
the unique complexities of everyone’s recovery journey (47). 
Personalized rehabilitation plans that consider specific impairments, 
functional goals, cognitive abilities, and psychosocial factors are 
essential. Integrating advanced technologies, such as artificial 
intelligence (AI) and machine learning, into rehabilitation protocols 
enables the customization of interventions based on real-time patient 
data and responses (199, 259). Wearable devices and sensor-based 
technologies provide objective measures, facilitating the monitoring 
of progress and the adaptation of rehabilitation strategies according to 
individual needs (260). Establishing a framework for personalized 
rehabilitation that combines clinical expertise with technological 
advancements holds significant potential in optimizing outcomes for 
stroke survivors.
8.5 Interdisciplinary collaboration and 
training
Effective stroke rehabilitation requires seamless collaboration 
among diverse healthcare professionals, each contributing specialized 
expertise. However, achieving interdisciplinary collaboration poses 
challenges in terms of communication, coordination, and shared 
decision-making among multidisciplinary teams (261). Enhancing 
collaboration necessitates specialized training programs that 
emphasize interdisciplinary skills, fostering a shared understanding of 
stroke rehabilitation across disciplines. Training initiatives that 
promote team-based care, communication strategies, and shared 
decision-making frameworks are pivotal in overcoming barriers to 
collaboration (262). Moreover, establishing interprofessional 
education programs during healthcare training cultivates a 
collaborative mindset among future healthcare providers. Encouraging 
interdisciplinary rounds, case conferences, and joint care planning 
sessions facilitate cohesive care delivery, optimizing rehabilitation 
outcomes for stroke survivors (262).
In navigating these challenges, there exist promising opportunities 
to revolutionize stroke rehabilitation. By addressing access disparities, 
individualizing care, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, the 
stroke rehabilitation landscape can evolve to provide more 
comprehensive, patient-centered, and effective care for stroke 
survivors. Continued innovation, research, and collaboration across 
healthcare sectors hold the potential to significantly enhance stroke 
rehabilitation outcomes in the future.
9 Future directions in stroke 
rehabilitation
9.1 Personalized rehabilitation approaches
The future of stroke rehabilitation lies in advancing personalized 
approaches tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of each 
individual. Embracing innovative technologies, such as artificial 
intelligence and machine learning algorithms, holds immense promise 
in developing more sophisticated and adaptive rehabilitation protocols 
(19). These technologies can analyze vast datasets, including genomic, 
neuroimaging, and behavioral information, to create individualized 
treatment plans. Moreover, exploring the integration of virtual reality, 
augmented reality, and gamification strategies can further enhance 
engagement and motivation in personalized rehabilitation programs 
(263). The future direction emphasizes a shift towards precision 
medicine in stroke rehabilitation, catering treatments uniquely to each 
patient’s biological, cognitive, and psychosocial profile.

9.2 Integrating neuroplasticity concepts
Understanding and leveraging neuroplasticity principles are 
at the forefront of future stroke rehabilitation strategies. 
Emphasizing interventions that harness the brain’s inherent ability 
to reorganize and adapt following injury is crucial. Innovative 
therapeutic approaches, such as non-invasive brain stimulation 
techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial 
direct current stimulation), target neuroplastic changes in the 
brain (264). Additionally, combining traditional rehabilitation 
with novel strategies, such as enriched environments, sensory 
stimulation, and task-specific training, promotes neuroplasticity 
and enhances functional recovery. The future direction focuses on 
optimizing interventions that exploit neuroplasticity mechanisms 
to facilitate greater and more sustained recovery in stroke 
survivors.
9.3 Advancements in assistive technologies
The future landscape of stroke rehabilitation is intertwined with 
rapid advancements in assistive technologies aimed at augmenting 
functional abilities and improving independence. Cutting-edge 
innovations in robotics, exoskeletons, and wearable devices offer 
promising avenues to enhance motor recovery and support activities 
of daily living. Advancements in BCIs aim to seamlessly integrate with 
the brain’s neural signals, allowing for more intuitive control of 
assistive devices (265). Moreover, developments in sensor technology 
and smart home systems enable a more connected and supportive 
environment for stroke survivors. The future direction underscores 
the integration of these assistive technologies into rehabilitation 
programs, aiming to empower stroke survivors, enhance their 
autonomy, and improve overall quality of life. These future directions 
herald a paradigm shift in stroke rehabilitation, focusing on 
individualization, neuroplasticity-driven approaches, and the 
integration of innovative assistive technologies. Continued research, 
collaboration, and technological advancements hold substantial 
promise in revolutionizing stroke rehabilitation practices, ultimately 
improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected 
by stroke.
